## Description
This code is an implementation of an ABCD Pattern Scanner in MQL5. The ABCD pattern is a popular chart pattern used in technical analysis to identify potential trading opportunities. The pattern consists of four price points (A, B, C, D) and is formed by a series of highs and lows. The code scans for the ABCD pattern and predicts market movement based on the pattern identified. It then executes trades accordingly.

## Input Parameters
- `MinimumPatternSize`: Minimum size of the pattern in pips.
- `MaximumPatternSize`: Maximum size of the pattern in pips.

## Initialization
The `OnInit` function sets the minimum and maximum pattern size in points and initializes global variables.

## Deinitialization
The `OnDeinit` function cleans up global variables when the expert advisor is deinitialized.

## Tick Function
The `OnTick` function is called on every tick and checks for the ABCD pattern. If the pattern is detected, it predicts market movement and identifies trading opportunities. If a trading opportunity is found, it executes the trade.

## Check Pattern
The `CheckPattern` function checks if the pattern size is within the specified range and if the current price has formed higher highs and lower lows. If the conditions are met, it sets the pattern high and low values and returns true.

## Predict Market Movement
The `PredictMarketMovement` function calculates the pattern range and stop loss and take profit levels. It then checks if the pattern suggests a bullish or bearish trend and if the current price is above or below the stop loss level. If the conditions are met, it returns true.

## Execute Trade
The `ExecuteTrade` function places a market order based on the pattern identification. If the pattern suggests a bullish trend, it buys at the current market price. If the pattern suggests a bearish trend, it sells at the current market price. It also notifies the user about the profitable trading pattern.
